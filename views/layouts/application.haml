          %h1 Who we are
          %h2 Professionalism and Care
          %p We are a friendly periodontal group in Houston, Texas, dedicated to giving you the finest and most attentive care possible. Periodontal disease is responsible for over 75% of all adult tooth loss in the United States. If you have been referred to our office by your general dentist, it is very likely that your periodontal infection has progressed beyond the mild stage. Please call us at (352) 351-5051 at your earliest convenience.
          %p On your first visit to our office, we will give you a thorough examination and discuss our findings. Our treatment recommendations tend to be conservative. We want you to be completely informed of your choices before proceeding with care.
          %p Our goal is to work closely with your general dentist to help you maintain your natural teeth for a lifetime. We hope you find this website a helpful introduction to our practice. If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to give us a call or e-mail us. Delaying treatment can have serious consequences.

          %h1 Patient Comfort
          %p While no dental procedure is 100% comfortable, we go to great lengths to minimize any discomfort you might feel.  Many of our patients make statements like, "This wasn't even painful?  How did you do that?" 
          %h2 Pre-medication
          %p Patient comfort is one of the most important aspects of care.  Different patients have different needs for pain and anxiety control medication. Depending upon the procedure and your wishes, there are many medications we can prescribe.
          %h2 Injections of Anesthesia
          %p Injections of dental anesthesia can become more painful if not precisely done or if the injection is done at too rapid a rate.  We recognize this and take extra care when giving injections. 
          %h2 Conscious Sedation
          %p For those patients that would feel more comfortable with conscious sedation, we are pleased to offer both intravenous sedation and nitrous oxide analgesia. Both of these techniques will make you feel relaxed and at ease. Although you will be awake, you will not be aware of your surroundings. Conscious sedation can allow you to remain calm during dental procedures, with minimal recollection of your visit.

          %h1 Periodontal Disease
          %p Periodontics is the branch of dentistry that deals with the care and treatment of the tissues surrounding and supporting your teeth. A periodontist is a dentist that specializes in the prevention and treatment of periodontal disease. Periodontists also place dental implants and can cosmetically enhance your smile through periodontal procedures.
          %p As periodontists, Drs. Darby and Johnson have received years of additional training in periodontics beyond their general dental degree. They have highly specialized knowledge and skill in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontal disease, options for cosmetic periodontal procedures and the placement of dental implants.
          %p The following will help you to better understand the procedures and conditions that Dr. Darby and Dr. Johnson are expert in dealing with

          %h2 Crown Lengthening & Gingival Contouring
          %p Sometimes the teeth are quite small in relation to the gum tissue. This can create an unattractive "gummy" smile. An uneven gum line can also be distracting.
          %p The gum line, and the bone just beneath the gum line, can be lowered to change the appearance of your smile. This can create a more even gum line or make the teeth appear longer. â€œGingival (gum) contouring" is the process of recontouring the gum only. "Crown lengthening" refers to recontouring of both gum and supporting bone.
          %p Procedure: Your periodontist administers a local anesthetic and gently recontours excess gum and bone tissue to expose more of your natural teeth.
